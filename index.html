          of post-traumatic stress disorder, such as anxiety, depression,
          hypersensitivity, and avoidance behaviors. While these responses stem
          from trauma and pain, without help, they can spread throughout all the
          avenues of our lives. Our site was created to offer inspirational
          content and information so that a life of happiness, peace, and safety
          could be found. Fitness Hacks offers a free online abuse dictionary

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          According to the NHS, adults over 65 should aim to be physically
          active every day. You can find the official guidance for adults
          between 19 and 64 here, but we’ll be focusing on older adults for now.
          The NHS recommends a combination of activities for optimum health and
          fitness. At least 2 days a week, older people should focus on
          activities that improve strength, balance, and flexibility. Throughout
          the rest of the week, you should do at least 150 minutes of moderate
          intensity activity. If you already lead an active lifestyle, you can
          do 75 minutes of vigorous intensity exercise instead, or a combination
          of moderate and vigorous exercise. Regardless of your level of
          fitness, everyone should try to reduce the time they spend sitting or
          laying down.
